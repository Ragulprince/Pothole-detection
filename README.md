# Pothole-detection
Pothole detecPothole detection using YOLOv7 is a computer vision project that uses deep learning algorithms to detect potholes on roads. YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that is used to detect and localize objects in images and video frames. The project requires a custom dataset of road images with potholes and without potholes.

The project starts with collecting the road images and labeling them with a suitable annotation tool to create the custom dataset. The dataset is then divided into training, validation, and testing sets. YOLOv7 is trained on the training set and the weights are saved. The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model and to fine-tune the hyperparameters. The testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

After training the model, it is used to detect potholes in real-world road images. The YOLOv7 algorithm generates bounding boxes around the detected potholes with high accuracy. The project can also be extended to detect other road-related objects such as speed bumps, road signs, etc.

The Github repository for this project would include the custom dataset, the YOLOv7 algorithm, and scripts to train and test the model on the dataset. The repository may also include pre-trained weights for the model and instructions for running the code on new road images. The project could be further improved by incorporating real-time video detection and developing a user-friendly interface for the end-users.tion using YOLOv7 is a deep learning project that uses custom datasets to train a model to detect potholes on roads.
